# Nigeria's Covid-19 Data Analysis Using Python - Project Overview
This project is focused on performing a detailed analysis of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) data of Nigeria, a West-African country. Nigeria is a country with 37 states, including the Federal Capital Territory. The goal is to apply data science and analytics skills to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualisations, and generate useful insights.

# Project Steps
The data for this project was sourced from multiple channels. COVID-19 data was obtained from the website of the Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC), the body that monitors COVID-19 trends in all the states in Nigeria using web scraping via this link: https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/

Also, daily data was sourced from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) on the number of confirmed, death and recovered cases across different countries, and then data specific for Nigeria is then extracted. The data is available at the links below:

* Global Daily Confirmed Cases - https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv
* Global Daily Recovered Cases - https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv
* Global Daily Death Cases - https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv

The analysis also considers the Nigeria Community Vulnerability Index data, which is computed based on a number of factors, including socioeconomic status, population density, housing type, transportation, epidemiological, health system etc.
Nigeria's quarterly real Domestic Gross Product data for 2014 to 2020 was also collected together with the states' initial and revised budget data, i.e., before and after the emergence of the pandemic.

The first step in this project is to understand the type and the nature of the data in order to ensure an adequate and accurate analysis. The data type in each column was checked and was converted to standard forms suitable for the intended analysis. The data was then explored to identify trends toward developing a comparative analysis of the COVID-19 data and generating useful insights. Finally, various visualisations were generated in the form of figures to enable an in-depth understanding of the dataset.

# Brief Insights
The regression analysis in this study shows that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased with population density. Also, the advent of COVID-19 triggered a decrease in the Real GDP of Nigeria in the year 2020. 

# Future Work
As an addition to this current work in the future, machine learning models can be deployed to acquire hidden knowledge from the dataset, which will enable the prediction of future trends. This knowledge discovery can help in preparing response teams for a faster response to anticipated developments.
